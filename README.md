Ideas to try:
====================

This competition has a causality rule: that is, model predictions on a test dataset 
cannot be inferred using future (e.g. unavailable information) training data. Therefore, in this case
crossvalidation needs some careful thought.


Here's ideas to try:

- Build 2x2 models: 2 for each target, and 2 for each year:
    + The model predicting on the end of 2016 can only use data prior to September 2016
    + The model predicting on the end of 2017 can use data prior to that (i.e. the training set from 2016 + 
        training from 2017)
